# CPP VSCode Bootstrap

This repository is a workspace that lets you start on your C++ projects on VSCode on the go.

Here are some features:

- It uses CMake to install dependencies.
- It uses GoogleTest for unit testing.
- It uses custom launch and build settings that you can customize.

There are just some few things to configure, ie. paths, before you could run things.

## Prerequisites
The folowwing should have been already installed to make this bootstrap work.
1. VSCode
2. CLang
3. CMake

## Nice to have extensions for VSCode
1. CMake Tools
2. C++ TestMate
3. C/C++ (intellisense)
